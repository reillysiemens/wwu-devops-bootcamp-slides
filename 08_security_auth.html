<p>Social engineering leverages those person-to-person skills us
computer folks are so well known for not having.  Can someone let
me borrow their laptop for a minute?  I just want to tell my mom
I'll be home late tonight... honest!</p>
<p>Pretexting is when someone contacts you with a pretext.  They sound
like they're authentic because they know something about you which
they probably got off Facebook or something else.  &quot;Hi, I'm calling
from Chase Bank and I noticed that your card might have been used
at a location where fraud was committed.  I have your name as Bob
Smith and your date of birth as May third, 1992.  Can you read me
your card number and the three digits on the back?&quot;</p>
<p>Phishing is something we've all been warned about.  We all know
that eBay and Paypal aren't going to email us asking for our bank
account information.  Just don't fall for it and you'll be okay.</p>
<p>Baiting is a little more interesting.  Ever walk down the street
and notice a thumb drive or SD card on the ground?  Hey -- free
thumb drive, right?  Let's just put it in the computer, what could
go wrong?  Plenty.  If it's too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
<p>Quid pro quo is a trade -- I'll give you something if you give me
something.  Would you trade your password for a chocolate bar?
According to the BBC, someone tried this outside a subway station
in London in 2004, and more than seventy percent of people took
that trade!  Thirty-four percent gave it up for free.  Don't do
that.</p>
<p>I suspect many of you who live in the dorms have been told about
tailgating.  You're unlocking the dorm door and someone comes up
and says &quot;hey, I forgot my key in my room, can you let me in&quot; or
maybe they're wearing a Domino's uniform and are carrying a pizza.
You're a nice person, you want to help them.  Don't do it.</p>
<p class="last">And that leaves us with zero-day vulnerabilities.  The term 'zero
day' refers to the amount of time that the folks who write and
maintain the code have had to fix it.  If they don't know about it,
they can't fix it.  This is why it's so important for us to report
vulnerabilities when we discover them as was discussed earlier.</p>

<article class="slide level-2" id="what-to-do-if-you-discover-a-vulnerability">
<h2>What to do if you discover a vulnerability</h2>
<p>First, test and document to verify that it exists.</p>
<p>Then, disclose it <em>privately</em> to those responsible for fixing it</p>
<p>Provide examples -- it's basically a bug report, but through private channels
(not public tracker yet!)</p>
<p>Give them time to release a patch before announcing it</p>
<p>Some places have bug bounties</p>

We use passwords for everything we do online.  Some (hopefully)
semi random grouping of letters, numbers, and symbols which when combined
with a username allow you to authenticate with a server or process.
There are a couple common attacks on passwords, the most common of which
is called a dictionary attack.  This uses the fact that words are easier
to remember than random characters, so it abuses human memory in order
to greatly reduce the search space for passwords.</p>
<p>pwgen + a password manager will help you have better passwords which you
don't even have to remember! <strong>DEMO</strong></p>
<p>Storing passwords on the server side is a whole other matter.  One of
the primary issues of concern is what happens if your server gets
compromised.  Lets say for instance that you just have a giant text file
that has the form &quot;username password&quot; on each row.  This would be super
fast to to lookup users in, but if that file ends up in the wrong hands,
you lose.  A better option is to not store the passwords directly, but
to store some representation of the password.  This is where a hash
comes in.  Essentially a hash is a one way function that is fast to
calculate, deterministic in output, but _very_ hard to reverse.  If you
store the hash of a password you can hash what they send you to verify
who they are.  Again we must consider what happens if our database was
compromised.  Since these hashes are deterministic and computing power
is so cheap, we can precalculate what passwords correspond to what
hashes, these precomputed files are called rainbow tables.  To avoid
the issue with rainbow tables we 'salt' our passwords.  This adds a
small random string to each password so that the search space for
precomputing possible passwords becomes tera/petabytes large.</p>
<p class="last">Enough about passwords, we now move into more interesting things called
keys!</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Keys are password files.  These can be used in place of a password for
authentication and encryption.</p>
<p>Symmetric keys essentially work like passwords.  They are basically a
one-time pad where both parties need to know the key to enable data to be
stored and retrieved.  Asymmetric keys work by encrypting with a public key
(one everyone can see), but only being able to be decrypted by the private
key (which you shouldn't show anyone).</p>
<p>The fundamental problem with communication is that if you don't have a
preshared key between two users, everything you say is being listened to and
presumably logged.</p>
<p class="last">Diffie Hellman key exchange is probably the most important result in
cryptography.  It allows two users to communicate in plaintext
(non-encrypted) and trade their public keys in order to generate a shared
secret so then they can communicate with encryption.  RSA is an algorithm
that follows Diffie-Hellman and is the most common way to do key exchange.</p>

<p>These types of attacks consist of code that is introduced into the
application causing unexpected behavior.  This code can be
introduced unintentionally by typical users who use quotes or
ampersands in their inputs as well as intentionally by nefarious folks.</p>
<p>The comic demonstrates a classic SQL injection attack.  Bobby took
advantage of the school's software not properly sanitizing their
inputs by including a command to drop the students table, causing
the kind of chaos often seen in xkcd comics.</p>
<p>Cross-site scripting works much the same way: someone posts a
comment on a blog which includes Javascript which gets executed
when you view the comment.  When it is executed, it does something
horrible like send them your cookie for that blog site.</p>
<p>Cross-site request forgeries are similar but instead of Javascript
you'll see image links that really point to another site like your
bank, hoping that your cookies will let them transfer money from
your accounts to theirs.</p>
<p>Remote site execution is what it sounds like: just like the SQL
injection attack, but instead running a shell command on the web
server.  I think by now you all have enough experience with running
commands on your virtual machines to know how bad that could be.</p>
<p class="last">Luckily, each of these threats can be addressed the same way:
listen to Bobby's mom and sanitize your inputs!  There's a web site
dedicated to helping developers with SQL injection threats which
I've listed above, but the same concepts apply to the other
threats.  Want to stop cross-site scripting?  Don't allow users to
contribute arbitrary Javascript in comments.  Want to stop cross
site request forgeries?  Make sure your GET requests are free of
side-effects, and include tokens in your forms.  As a bonus, Django
will do that last bit for you if you let it -- check out that
second link up there for more details.  That third link is the
Rails security guide and provides advice on these issues as well as
many others.</p>

<p>There is a constant battle between developers and the bad guys --
one side discovers vulnerabilities, the other side fixes them.  One
of the easiest things to do to keep the bad guys out is to use the
most up-to-date version of your web server, regardless of whether
it's Apache or IIS or nginx.</p>
<p>The graph above shows the most popular versions of Apache as of
February 2014 according to Netcraft.  Apache encourages admins to
run the latest major release of the 2.4 stable branch, which is
Apache 2.4.7.  How many of those releases do you see in that image?
That's right -- none.  Heck, two of the top fifteen are EOLed --
they aren't even receiving security updates any longer!  This is
bad.  Don't be like them.</p>
<p class="last">But it's not enough to run the latest version.  You should also
make sure your configuration files are updated as well.  Some
default configurations will include accounts or passwords which can
be guessed by hackers.  Other times certain features will be
enabled by default, which can introduce vulnerabilities you don't
expect even though you're not using those features.  Read the
release notes when you update your software.  Pay attention to
details.  They will.  You should too.</p>

<li>Authentication and Authorization</li>

</ul>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The remaining threats facing the typical web developer come down to
design and implementation problems.  The fine points of
authentication and authorization have been discussed already: make
sure that all your actions are authorized by authenticated users
and you should be okay.</p>
<p>Also, don't let your cookies have infinite lifetimes.  Better to
have your users occasionally log in again than let them be
vulnerable to those cross-site attacks we covered before.  Pro tip:
PHP has a default setting for &quot;session.cookie_lifetime&quot; of zero,
which means they never expire.  If you're using PHP, fix that.</p>
<p class="last">Information leakage is pretty sneaky.  Let's say your app allows
users to request a password reset by entering their email
addresses.  If your app behaves differently when valid and invalid
addresses are input, congratulations, you're leaking information.
Unauthorized directory access is a specialized form of information
leakage -- while it's nice to let people know how to contact your
staff, you might not want to let them download everyone's email
address and such.</p>
