<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>Email questions to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:devopsbootcamp&#37;&#52;&#48;osuosl&#46;org">devopsbootcamp<span>&#64;</span>osuosl<span>&#46;</span>org</a> if they aren't answered here!</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="is-this-a-for-credit-class">
<h2>Is this a for-credit class?</h2>
<p>No, although the curriculum is based on <a class="reference external" href="http://catalog.oregonstate.edu/CourseDetail.aspx?subjectcode=CS&amp;coursenumber=312">CS312</a>, Linux System Administration,
which hasn't been offered for several years.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="what-does-it-cost">
<h2>What does it cost?</h2>
<p>Financially, it's free. However, to benefit from the hands-on learning
opportunities that we'll be offering, you should plan to commit 5 or more
hours per week to attending lectures and playing with the tools and
technologies that the lectures will discuss.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="i-don-t-know-about-computers-can-i-still-join">
<h2>I don't know about computers! Can I still join?</h2>
<p>YES! If you already knew all this stuff, you'd be teaching rather than studying
it. If you think you don't know enough, try anyway -- in the worst case you'll
discover that your self-assessment was correct, and in the best case you'll
become a successful open source contributor.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="when-will-meetings-be">
<h2>When will meetings be?</h2>
<p>Weekday evenings, with a day of the week being chosen during the first meeting.
We try to choose a day that works best for most students but it's always
difficult to find something that works for everyone. For example, last year we had
meetings on Thursdays.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="is-this-only-for-students">
<h2>Is this only for students?</h2>
<p>No, anyone from the community can participate. Parts of the earlier lessons
will assume access to student resources, but we can work with non-students on
an individual basis to get them access to equivalent tools. Community members
can use the <cite>Visitor</cite> wifi network when on campus.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="what-s-the-difference-between-bootcamp-and-regular-lug-meetings">
<h2>What's the difference between BootCamp and regular LUG meetings?</h2>
<p>Regular LUG meetings are usually targeted toward an intermediate to expert
audience, and make no attempt to comprehensively teach a set of skills across
multiple meetings. We might teach about version control one week, privacy
tools the next, and a new open source project by a local company the next.</p>
<p>DevOps BootCamp will provide continuity and comprehensive open source
education that's outside the scope of regular LUG meetings. As you progress
through Bootcamp, you'll understand more and more of the technical content of
LUG talks.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="i-wasn-t-able-to-participate-during-fall-term-can-i-still-join">
<h2>I wasn't able to participate during Fall term. Can I still join?</h2>
<p>Yes! Please read through lessons 1-3 (linked from the curriculum page) and
ask in IRC if you have trouble following the instructions for them. Catch up
on that content and you'll be ready to join in Winter term.</p>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="i-have-a-question">
<h2>I have a question?</h2>
<p>Ask it on IRC if you have that set up, or email <a class="reference external" href="mailto:devopsbootcamp&#37;&#52;&#48;osuosl&#46;org">devopsbootcamp<span>&#64;</span>osuosl<span>&#46;</span>org</a> or the
mailing list.</p>
