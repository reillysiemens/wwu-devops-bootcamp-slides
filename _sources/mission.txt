Purpose of DevOps BootCamp
==========================

From front page:
----------------

DevOps BootCamp is an OSU Open Source Lab and OSU Linux Users Group program
aimed at boosting our impact and outreach while shrinking the skills gap for OSU
students interested in DevOps.

From FAQ: 
---------

DevOps BootCamp will provide continuity and comprehensive open source education
that’s outside the scope of regular LUG meetings.

"The Deal"
----------

Students get:

* Mentorship from students and professionals with advanced skills in software
  development and systems administration
* Professional connections in the software industry
* A welcoming environment to start learning in, if you've always wanted to
  learn about software development and systems administration but never been sure
  where to start
* An opportunity to fill in any gaps in your knowledge, if you’re a
  self-taught coder or sysadmin
* The skills to build and deploy open source software, or contribute to
  existing projects

Why we’re offering this:

* The OSL gets a larger pool of candidates to recommend to companies
  interested in recruiting OSL students
* The OSL gets to work with a wider variety of students, which fits better
  with its new status as part of the school of EECS
* The open source community gets more contributors to its projects

 
Target Audience
---------------

Our goal is to make the DevOps BootCamp program accessible to students and
community members from all different backgrounds. You have to want to learn, and
be willing to ask questions whenever you don't understand something, and be open
to making time to play with the cool tools/toys which we’ll be teaching you
about.
