What is DevOps?
===============


DevOps (a portmanteau of software development and server operations)
represents the integration between software development and operations
engineering that has become increasingly necessary with the emergence of cloud
computing. In essense, the jobs are no longer mutually exclusive- developers
need more operations-based knowledge in order to understand how their
application will be deployed, test locally and preemptively address potential
security risks, while systems administrators need to know developer-based
materials in order to design infrastructure optimally to fit an application's
needs without wasting capacity and to troubleshoot issues with the
increasingly complex software cycle. Additionally, site reliability
engineering and many modern security roles require a background with a balance
between development and operations.
