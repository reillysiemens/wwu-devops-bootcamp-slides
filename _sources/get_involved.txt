Get Involved
============

Mailing list
------------

Join the `mailing list`_ for updates.

IRC
---

Join us on ``irc.freenode.net`` in ``#devopsbootcamp`` (students will be setting
up an IRC network for the program in a later lesson).

Website & Curriculum
--------------------

If you'd like to help edit this site, `email devopsbootcamp`_ or ping anyone in
``#devopsbootcamp`` on Freenode with your github username to get access to the
web site repo.  You'll also want to learn the `ReStructured Text`_ markup
language to edit the site, if you don't already know it.

Meetings
--------

We typically meet weekly in KEC 1007 or 1005 depending on the room schedules.
Please check back later for when our first meeting in the Fall will be.
Recurring meeting times following the first meeting will be decided based on the
availability of those who show up for the first meeting. Last year we met on
Thursdays from 6-8pm.
